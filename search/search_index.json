Kathy argued for sticking with JSON in the short term to avoid complicating implementation, though acknowledging that formats may evolve over time. Jonathan supported being explicit about the format, while Nathan proposed a flexible approach allowing users to request different formats (e.g., protobuf or LinkML) via a query parameter. Kathy highlighted that PhenoPackets used LinkML, which auto-generates JSON Schema, making it a potentially solved problem for PhenoPackets.  The group considered adding format as metadata for future-proofing, and debated whether multiple schema formats should be included in the registry. Nathan emphasized the importance of computability for the Schema Registry, advocating for including multiple formats to support diverse use cases. The format should be a required metadata component if we choose this approach, but the approach to handling schema distribution (either via direct API access or additional metadata endpoints) needs further discussion.</p> <p>2024-09-20 -- Andy Yates previously raised an issue about JSON Schema lacking full expressivity for schema descriptions. </p> <p>2024-08-02 \u2013 From the perspective of the spec, we can support anything, and thus don\u2019t need to require or enforce a specific format but for usability and interoperability, it\u2019s better to be in JSON schema.
