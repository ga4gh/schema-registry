<!-- Include auto-generated md from openAPI yaml file for API specification itself -->

[OAD(./docs/specification.yaml)]

Notes:

There is not currently anything defined at `/schemas`. This is intentional: the
namespace attribute is mandatory, and forms part of the path to a specific schema
version. Future revisions of the specification may include something here if a need
arises.
