# Schema registry specification

## What is the schema registry specification?

The GA4GH Schema registry specification provides a standard for representing and sharing schemas. It can be implemented by independent provides, which can then interoperate to share schemas across domains.

## Can I see a demo?

We are still developing the specification itself. Once the spec is developed, people will be able to implement independent services that conform to the specification. These services can then be used to share schemas.
